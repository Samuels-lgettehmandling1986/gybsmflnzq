Just walked out of Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare and my brain feels like a jumble of scattered gold pieces on the shop floor. My back is sore from those damn sticky seats—no cushion left in them—and popcorn crumbs are still stuck to my jeans like barnacles to an old ship. God, it was noisy in there too. The theater seemed to echo like a bell, but I digress.

Hooked from the start, literally how Captain Hook—his whole redemption arc was like trying to forge silver with bare hands, all clunky but somehow it became beautiful towards the end. That scene with the crocodile dreaming of flying? Utter madness but strangely poetic, like a shattered bracelet you didn't expect to love.

I mean, Tinker Bell was glowing like freshly polished gems—it hurt my eyes at first, a clashing glare against the dark. Felt like being hit with one of those LED magnifiers we use at the shop sometimes, the kind that makes even the diamonds try to dive back into the earth. She's gone grayscale, her rainbow dust turned into a kind of moody fog—sure wasn't the sparkly fairy tale I remember but I couldn't turn away.

> I swear, at some point the Lost Boys started looking like they're trapped in an unyielding time loop—never aging, constantly battling—kinda made me think of my workshop on a busy Christmas Eve. Tick-tock, tick-tock, never-ending, only here it’s with shadows playing twister around reality.

The pirates?! Almost dropped my popcorn bucket when they appeared like rough-cut stones, jagged and unpredictable. There was a part where Smee's face looked like it'd been sculpted directly from the pages of a memory book left in a damp corner—weathered, timeless, and somehow endearing, almost like when grandpa would tell me those long dusty stories by the fire.

Someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but honestly uncertain if that would capture this wild gemstone of a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , they said, like it could be confined to a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥, ha! The magic seeps from that screen like molten gold, you can’t reforge it.

What a kaleidoscope of chaos, friends turning enemies, islands moving like shifting sands, everything disjointed but there’s something kind of beautifully tragic about it. I'll have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again, I'm sure I missed a dozen easter eggs glittering in that pandemonium.

I think one of the scenes is still rattling around my skull, the one with Peter shouting from the treetops Am I nothing but dust? Saddened me and yet, just like every time I breathe on a piece of glass and it fogs, just to remind me it was once clear, only to wipe it away again.
